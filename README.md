A tool used to create random items for an RPG, Use as is, or modify it as you see fit.

This tool was made for Proc Jam in November 2019. Made it in about a week and a half.

Item Generator is straightforward to use. Select the item type, then the subtype, then the level, and click the button to create a random item.
The stats and the variance of the item's attributes will increase as the item level increases.

Once an item is generated, you can save the item as an XML file, which you can then use for your own games.
